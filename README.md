### TIC TAC TOE

- The main objective here is to understand decision algorithms
- The scructure and organization of code is a secondary focus
- The "beauty" of the game will not be taken into account, since the game will only be used as a environment in which the decision algorithms will be worked on.

### TO-DOS
- [ ] Parse args to change difficulty, time before reset position and decision algorithm to be used
- [x] Minimax
- [ ] Alpha-beta pruning 
- [ ] Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
